Arx is a speed dating website that consists of dating based on a single chat for a certain time. Meet new people through conversations, generate chemistry and find your better half

# You need this ✅

1. Install node and npm/yarn (you can see more detail in this link https://nodejs.org/en/)

2. Install Mongodb module (if you want, you can use npm install -g mongodb in your terminal command tool)

3. Set in your Enviroment Variables the data base credentials (https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v8.x/docs/api/process.html)

# Server 🖥

You can see the server running by following this link 👉 http://arx-speeddating.herokuapp.com/

# Technologies 🤓 

The application runs in two main servers, the back.end in an Express server on port 3001 and the front-end in a React based application on port 3000.

- HTML, CSS, Javascript, MongoDB, Express Js, React, Passport, WebSockets, APIs

# Install 💽

```
cd arx
cd back-end
npm install
npm start
```

This same process has to be done for the front-end: (you can also use yarn start instead of npm start)

```
cd arx
cd front-end
npm start
npm run build
```

The npm run build, generates a folder called build in the front-end which represents a static version of the front running in port 8080, the npm start means running the front for development purposes.
